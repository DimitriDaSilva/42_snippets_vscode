# 42_snippets_vscode

If you use VS Code at 42, this will probably interest you! :fire:<br>
I had a bit of fun creating custom snippets to improve my workflow at 42 :nerd_face: and wanted to share them with the 42 community! :hugs:<br>

## Setting up the snippets

You'll simply need to copy the snippet files in your computer. Yes, that's about it. :ok_hand:

Depending on your plaform, your user snippets file is located here:
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Code\User\snippets`
- **Mac**: `$HOME/Library/Application Support/Code/User/snippets`
- **Linux**: `$HOME/.config/Code/User/snippets`

## Snippets for .c files
 
### 42_new_comment

**What it does:** creates a Norminette-approved boilerplate to comment a function. No more excuses not to comment your code :eyes:<br>
**Prefixes to use it:** `new_comment` or `nc`

### includes_custom 

**What it does:** adds an include with the same header file name as your current file (e.g. in ft_test.c: `#include "ft_test.h"`)<br>
**Prefixes to use it:** `include_custom` or `ic`


## Resources
